## Introduction

Neetcode questions are a set of questions from leetcode coding platform that offers a wide range of coding problems to help you enhance your programming skills. This repository serves as a collection of my solutions to these problems. By sharing my solutions, I aim to provide a reference for others who may be studying or practicing coding.

## Languages

The problems in this repository have been solved using Java programming language.

Feel free to contribute solutions in additional languages by following the contribution guidelines mentioned below.

## Structure

The repository is structured in the following way:

├── Set of Problems of similar type<br>
│ ├──LeetcodeProblemNumber_Problem_Name.java<br>
│ │ ├── Solution Codes (Mostly contains 2 -3 solutions based on complexity)<br>
│ ├── ...<br>
│ └── ...<br>
├── ...<br>
└── ...<br>

Each problem is organized within a directory named after the similar type of problems such as arrays, hashset etc. Inside the same directory, you will find a directory for each problem, containing the 1 - 3 solution codes.

## Usage
